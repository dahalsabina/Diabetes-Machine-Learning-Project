    "**Diabetes Dataset Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory Data Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The diabetes dataset is composed on 100k samples (rows) with 9 total columns. The target variable, diabetes, is binary: patient has diabetes (1), patient does not have diabetes (0). The explanatory variables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "columns_to_encode = ['gender', 'smoking_history']   -> used one hot vector\n",
    "\n",
    "columns_to_scale = ['age', 'bmi', 'HbA1c_level', 'blood_glucose_level']  -> used standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "columns_no_scale = ['hypertension', 'heart_disease'] -> already encoded to 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to note that the target variable, diabetes, is highly skewed. There are a total of 91500 patients that do not have diabetes and 8500 that are diabetic. This raised concerns as we trained algorithms and tested results. It is much easier to predict 0's because of how many patients do not have diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Throughout this analysis we are focusing on recall as the most important evaluation score. This is because it is more dangerous to classify a diabetic individual as healty than it is to diagnose a healthy person as having diabetes. We must focus on the error rate of individuals who have diabetes (class 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for outliers -> there were no outliers\n",
    "- Check for missing values -> there were no missing values\n",
    "- One Hot Vector -> applied one hot encoding to ['gender', 'smoking_history'] \n",
    "- Standardization -> standardized the following quantitative variables  ['age', 'bmi', 'HbA1c_level', 'blood_glucose_level']\n",
    "- Split Train, Dev, and Test Set -> used 80,000 for train, 10,000 for dev, and 10,000 for test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit our data to five algorithms and the recall values for class 1 (Diabetes) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SGD Classifier: 0.716\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: 0.6\n",
    "- SVC Classifier: 0.825\n",
    "- KNeighbors: 0.63\n",
    "- Decision Tree: 0.728\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue with the two models with the highest recall scores -> SVC and Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",

    "**Comparisons**\n",
    "\n",
    "Desision Tree has a higher 'best score' value for the train set 0.73 and higher recall (0.8644) and f1-score (0.86) values\n",
    "The SVC Classifier has a higher accuracy (0.9612) and precision (0.94) value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall accuracy is not a good evaluation measurement for this data set because the target variable is highly imbalanced. \n",
    "The SVC classifier has a higher precision value meaning it is better at correctly predicting false positives (individuals who were classified as having diabetes but are healthy). The decision tree model has a higher recall value meaing it is better at correctly predicting false negatives (individuals who were classified as being healthy, but have diabetes). It is more important that we use recall for model evaluation. For that reason, the best prediction model for this dataset is using the Decision Tree algorithm with hypertuned parameters. \n",
